# Tic-Tac-Toe App

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe App! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React with TypeScript. 
The goal is to provide an entertaining and interactive experience for users to play this timeless game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-app.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe-app
3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install

## Software Used
This project makes use of the following software:

#### React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. To install React in your project, use:
    npx create-react-app my-tic-tac-toe
    cd my-tic-tac-toe

#### TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language. To install TypeScript, use:

    npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest

#### FontAwesome: Provides a collection of icons and symbols. To install FontAwesome, add the following link to your HTML file:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">

## Usage: 

To run the app in development mode, use the following command:
    ```npm start

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to play the game. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

## Rules to Play

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid with either the X or O symbol. You can choose to start each game with either symbol. The player who succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. Easy, right? Play to find out!

## Build for Production

To build the app for production, use the following command:
    npm run build

The production-ready build will be located in the build folder.
